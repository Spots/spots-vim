# Steven's vim environment

Yeah, uh, it's vim and stuff.

## Installing
In your home folder git clone this repo as your .vim folder. Then symlink the vimrc file in it to your .vimrc in your home folder.

## Included Bundles

* Vundle for managing the bundles
* NERDTree for dir browsing
* railscasts theme cause it's easy on my eyes
* vim-indent-guides shows those pesky indent trees
* YAIFA to automanage indent styles
* vim-bufferline to show open buffers in the status line
* vim-bbye to make closing buffers easier. mapped to \q

##Font
I like the bitstream_vera_mono font that Railscasts uses. I included the font in the fonts/ folder included in the repo. Install it however appropriate for your OS and then configure your terminal app to use that font.
